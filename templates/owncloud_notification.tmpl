Dear Abuse teams,
 
 CIRCL is the CERT/CSIRT (Computer Emergency Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team) for the private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg.
 
 We found out that at the time of writing the following list of hosts appears to be running an outdated and vulnerable version of ownCloud/Nextcloud, openly accessible from the Internet:

  $details

 The vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the data stored in the cloud. Attackers could potentially get access to sensitive information like private documents, photos or customer data from companies and subsequently publish this information on the Internet or utilize it for criminal activities like blackmailing. Other vulnerabilites can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the cloud server and potentially lead to a full compromise of the system and its abuse for further criminal activities.

 Nextcloud GmbH provided us via our German counterpart CERT-Bund with the results of their tests for assistance with notification of affected parties.
 
 Nextcloud GmbH provides detailed information on the vulnerabilities identified with each cloud instance at:
