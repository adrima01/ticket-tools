Dear Abuse teams,
Dear DPO,

 You or your organisation is operating one or more Sophos Server. The server is probably vulnerable to the CVEs listed below.

 It is critical to update to a safe version as soon as possible since multiple CVEs allow remote attackers to DoS or achieve RCE (Remote code execution) on the firewall. Those vulnerabilities are currently used in ransomware campaign and could damage your network.

 It is highly recommended to prioritize following the mitigation and upgrade steps Veeam recommends. As these vulnerabilities were already exploited in the wild, we strongly recommend to review the security and especially the logs of your Sophos Server for any indicators of exploitation.

 In case of positive identification of a compromised server, don't forget to follow the data privacy regulation laws in Europe. It is necessary to identify the problem in detail, identify the leaked personal data and affected people, and contact CNPD within 72 hours to comply with the law and in order to notify the affected people about the leak.

 If you need any support or additional information, don't hesitate to get back to us.
