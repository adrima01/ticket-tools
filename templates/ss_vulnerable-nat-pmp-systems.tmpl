Vulnerability report: Vulnerable NAT-PMP Systems in your network 
Dear Abuse teams,
 
 CIRCL is the CERT/CSIRT (Computer Emergency Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team) for the private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg.
 
 We have been informed by a trusted source that at the time of writing the following list of client(s) appears to be vulnerable NAT-PMP systems[1]. Timestamps are in UTC+0.

  $details

 What are possible solutions?
 
 (1) Configure NAT-PMP Securely
 Developers and administrators implementing NAT-PMP should exercise care to ensure that devices are configured securely, specifically that the LAN and WAN interfaces are correctly assigned, NAT-PMP requests are only accepted on internal interfaces, and port mappings are only opened for the requesting internal IP address.

 (2) Update miniupnpd
 Although the NAT-PMP vulnerabilities are not due to flaws in miniupnpd's code, an update has been released that more strictly enforces RFC 6886. As of version 1.8.20141022, miniupnpd discards NAT-PMP packets received on the WAN interface. The default configuration file, miniupnpd.conf, now contains additional comments to encourage more secure configurations.
 
 (3) Restrict Access
 Deploy firewall rules to block untrusted hosts from being able to access port 5351/udp.

 (4) Disable NAT-PMP
 Consider disabling NAT-PMP on the device if it is not absolutely necessary. 

 
 Don't hesitate to get back to us if you have further questions or need additional support or want to inform us about false positives.
 
 We would appreciate if you confirm the reception of this report.
