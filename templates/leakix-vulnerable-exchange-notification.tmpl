Vulnerability report: Vulnerable Exchange server: $address
Dear Abuse teams,
Dear DPO,
 
 CIRCL is the CERT/CSIRT (Computer Emergency Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team) for the private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg.
 
 You or your organisation is operating one or more Microsoft Exchange Server which hasn't been updated to the latest version. It is possible the server is already compromised and needs your immediate attention.

  $details


 We have evaluated the Exchange server banner to identify the currently running software version. While the risk of false positives exists, it is very likely that the identified information is correct.

 We have collected some additional information at these URLs: 
 - https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-64/
 - https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-72/

 It is recommended to prioritize installing updates on Exchange Servers which are externally facing. All affected Exchange Servers should ultimately be updated. Some of the vulnerabilities were already exploited in the wild, we strongly recommend to review the security and especially the logs of your Microsoft Exchange Server for any indicators of exploitation.

 Patching only is not sufficient. There were already Microsoft Exchange servers compromised by the 0-day and installed with persistent backdoor in the system. This means you can have a patched system with one or more threat-actors still having access. We strongly recommend to review the logs and apply standard incident response procedures for this machine and all connected infrastructure.

 In case of positive identification of a compromised server, don't forget to follow the data privacy regulation laws in Europe. It is necessary to identify the problem in detail, identify the leaked personal data and affected people, and contact CNPD within 72 hours to comply with the law and in order to notify the affected people about the leak.

 If you need any support or additional information, don't hesitate to get back to us.
 
 Please acknowledge the reception of this security notification.


 Best regards,
