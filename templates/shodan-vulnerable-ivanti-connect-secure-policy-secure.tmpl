 or on Ivanti's website: https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB-CVE-2023-46805-Authentication-Bypass-CVE-2024-21887-Command-Injection-for-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-and-Ivanti-Policy-Secure-Gateways?language=en_US

 We strongly recommend that you investigate whether your system has been compromised and update the software as soon as possible. Keep in mind that updating the software alone may not be sufficient, as a compromised system can remain compromised even after updating.

 In the event that you identify a compromise, it is important to follow the data privacy regulations in your region. This may include identifying the extent of the compromise and the personal data that has been leaked, as well as contacting the relevant authorities within 72 hours to comply with the law and notify affected individuals.

 Given the criticality of this vulnerability and as there are not yet patches available for all software versions, a recommended mitigation is to disconnect the server from the network.

 If you need any support or additional information, please don't hesitate to contact us. We would also appreciate it if you could acknowledge receipt of this security notification.

 Best regards,
