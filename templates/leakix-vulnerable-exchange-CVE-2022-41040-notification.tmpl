 You or your organisation is operating one or more Microsoft Exchange Server. The server is probably vulnerable to CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082, which allows remote code execution (RCE) when Exchange PowerShell is accessible to the attacker.

 It is recommended to prioritize following the mitigation steps Microsoft recommends. The vulnerabilities were already exploited in the wild, we strongly recommend to review the security and especially the logs of your Microsoft Exchange Server for any indicators of exploitation. No patch is available at this point in time.

 In case of positive identification of a compromised server, don't forget to follow the data privacy regulation laws in Europe. It is necessary to identify the problem in detail, identify the leaked personal data and affected people, and contact CNPD within 72 hours to comply with the law and in order to notify the affected people about the leak.
