 Multiple organisations in various countries were compromised using Ivanti Pulse Connect Secure products. The threat-actor(s) used different old and new vulnerabilities to gain access to publicly facing Pulse Connect Secure devices. 

 It is recommended to prioritize installing the proposed mitigation on Pulse Connect Secure Servers immediately until the promised patch is available.

 Please see https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-63/#recommendation for more details.

 All affected Servers should ultimately be updated when the update is published by the vendor.

 Also, there is an integrity checker available from Ivanti, available here: https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755/?kA13Z000000fzZV
