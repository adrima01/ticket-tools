Abuse report: Accessible mDNS hosts in your network 
Dear Abuse teams,
 
 CIRCL is the CERT/CSIRT (Computer Emergency Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team) for the private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg.
 
 We have been informed by a trusted source that at the time of writing the following list of IP(s) appear to be publicly accessible mDNS servers [1][2][3]. If a host is found to have the services "_workstation._tcp.local" or "_http._tcp.local" running, secondary probes are performed to collect whatever system information is returned. Some of the information that may be returned includes: trivial name of the device, IPv4 and IPv6 address(es) of the device (this may include RFC1918 addresses that are not meant to be leaked), MAC address information of the device, and potentially other information. Timestamps are in UTC+0.

  $details

 What are possible solutions?
 
 (1) Disable the service if not needed

 (2) Implement access lists to restrict access to this service

 
 Don't hesitate to get back to us if you have further questions or need additional support or want to inform us about false positives.
 
 We would appreciate if you confirm the reception of this report.
